# Play API REST Tester [Play 2.4 - Scala]

This is a companion project to test the example template [Play API REST Template](https://github.com/adrianhurt/play-api-rest-seed).

Run first the template:

    [play-api-rest-seed] $ run

It will run it on port 9000 as default. Then run the tester on other port:

    [play-api-rest-tester] $ run -Dhttp.port=8999

Within your browser, go to `http://localhost:8999/` and play with the API.

To customize it and set your own prepared requests for your API calls, you only have to modify the `requests.coffee` file.

And please, don't forget starring this project if you consider it has been useful for you.
